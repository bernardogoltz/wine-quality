# Wine Quality Classifier Predictor
--- 
One-Afternoon project: Red Wine Quality prediction model using a pratice dataset from Kaggle. This repository was inspired by 
Siddhardhan course "Hands-on Machine Learning Course with Python"

What are the more optimized way to drink a good wine without spending an excessive amount of money? And, if you are rich, what are the BETTER wine available at the market? 

Starting from a classic study dataset. We use the Random Forests method to classify the quality of wine.

### [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
Two datasets are included, related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests (see [Cortez et al., 2009]

### Data Set Information
The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult: [Web Link] or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods. For more information, read [Cortez et al., 2009].

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
